Huis Marseille has been offering a varied exhibition program in which photography's rich history and diverse uses are given consideration. The museum provides a view of the 'landscape' taking shape in photography; it presents photographers, artists and forms of photography which do justice to visual quality and which can be counted among the medium's major, but also lesser known, highlights. This stands in contrast to the profusion of photography as a mass medium. The unique structure of this house plays a significant role. Each of the fourteen exhibition spaces has its own specific character. The building still has the atmosphere of a 'gentleman's residence', but its rooms have now become galleries. A sense of warmth and intimacy has remained. Huis Marseille strives to make the visitor feel welcome in these home-like surroundings.",

    "description": "Welcome to the MLB Gallery: an artist's exhibition space on the Witte de Withstraat in Amsterdam' trendy old west. Each month we feature a new exhibition. And they are often a surprise. The range of styles and techniques is from gifted amateurs to professional artists with credentials. The resulting artworks are always different if not unique. Sometimes beautiful, sometimes touching, sometimes experimental. But, again, more of than not, surprising! It's affordable art because MLB does NOT take a big commission on sold artwork. The artist is the director, promoter and sales person who is present during the opening hours of the space. Background Some ten years ago, Marie-Louise Boel found a former vegetable shop for rent. She needed only an office space and, as for the rest of the area, something that would be attractive to her clients. A gallery seemed to be the perfect solution. And, now, a decade later, it is a focal point on the Witte de Withstraat. The aim is to show \"art\" in all its manifestations. The artist rents the gallery space. Ms Boel, along with Mieke Schulte, the assistant gallery holder, advise the artist on the rudimentaries of mounting an exhibition. Your own solo show The duration for a show is one month. You rent the space for this period. You design and make the posters, invitation cards and arrange for the opening reception with our help and professional support. Over the course of the exhibition you sit, at the gallery, during the opening hours for the space. The minimal time you are expected to be present is on Saturdays between noon and six p.m. Duo shows, featuring a painter and sculpture, as an example, is possible. The gallery is also open on Fridays between noon and six p.m.",

He introduced a new way of urban planning, in which there was room for wide streets, atmospheric squares and green parks. The characteristic architecture of the many Amsterdam School artists still adorns the street plan. The expressionistic facades and beautiful ornaments are recognizable throughout the neighborhood. Residential complex De Dageraad is the Amsterdam School in its purest form. Architects Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer were commissioned to design all facets of the streetscape. In addition to the street facades, they also designed the rear facades and floor plans. This led to a form of total art in which beauty was central. Museum De Dageraad is the starting point for many walks and cycling tours in the neighbourhood.",
