Huis Marseille has been offering a varied exhibition program in which photography's rich history and diverse uses are given consideration. The museum provides a view of the 'landscape' taking shape in photography; it presents photographers, artists and forms of photography which do justice to visual quality and which can be counted among the medium's major, but also lesser known, highlights. This stands in contrast to the profusion of photography as a mass medium. The unique structure of this house plays a significant role. Each of the fourteen exhibition spaces has its own specific character. The building still has the atmosphere of a 'gentleman's residence', but its rooms have now become galleries. A sense of warmth and intimacy has remained. Huis Marseille strives to make the visitor feel welcome in these home-like surroundings.",

He introduced a new way of urban planning, in which there was room for wide streets, atmospheric squares and green parks. The characteristic architecture of the many Amsterdam School artists still adorns the street plan. The expressionistic facades and beautiful ornaments are recognizable throughout the neighborhood. Residential complex De Dageraad is the Amsterdam School in its purest form. Architects Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer were commissioned to design all facets of the streetscape. In addition to the street facades, they also designed the rear facades and floor plans. This led to a form of total art in which beauty was central.
